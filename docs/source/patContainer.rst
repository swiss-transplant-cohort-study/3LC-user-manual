5.2. Treatment

.. image:: Treatm1.png

The container ‘Treatment’ contains ‘drug-prescriptions’ as well as ‘non-pharmacological treatments’.

In the ‘drug prescription’ we distinguish between:

*	Induction
*	Maintenance Immunosuppression
*	Infectious disease prophylaxis and
*	Other Drugs

Per default, when accessing the treatment container you land on the register with the ‘Active Treatments’. You can easily switch to ‘All Treatments’ (where active and stopped drugs are shown) or ‘Stopped Treatments’ in the register.

When entering a new treatment you can select the toggle product or substance and then search for the according item from the list.

If a product is not in the list, please switch to the "Substance" tab (see green arrow) and enter the substance of the product.

If possible, in the immunosuppressive treatment use product names (Prograf ®, Advagraf®, CellCept®, Myfortic®, etc.) so that drug changes can be easily followed.
In all other drugs choose the entry that is easier for you (e.g. Instead of entering Amlodipin/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazid as three different substances enter it as one product, Exforge HCT®).

5.2.1 Induction
=====================

.. note:: An induction therapy is given to ‘prepare’ the recipient for a new organ. The induction can be given shortly before and after TX or –e.g. in ABO-incompatible living donation- for a longer period prior to TX. Induction therapy may be given also as prophylaxis or therapy in case of an acute rejection.

Every treatment that is used for induction has to be indicated. If the induction was initiated prior to the transplantation (for instance for ABO incompatible transplantations) the date of induction treatment (e.g. one month or earlier before transplantation) has to be entered in the database.

Use the “Add medication”-button if there is more than one Induction therapy.

Special cases of induction
-----------------------------------

Plasmapheresis prior to a [living (kidney-)] transplantation has to be entered as induction in the ‘Non-pharmacological treatment’ section.

If a Patient with Islets-TX recieves Enbrel® (Etanerceptum), enter this as Induction.

Induction given in more than one dose
-----------------------------------------

Induction, even if given in two or more doses on e.g. Day 0 and Day +4, should be entered as one entry with the first application as start date and the last application as stopp date.

5.2.2. Maintenance immunosuppression
========================================

.. note:: The maintenance immunosuppression is given to avoid a rejection of the new organ.

Any glucocorticoid treatment is recorded as maintenance immunosuppression and not induction. Please differenciate between i.v. and p.o. application form (i.e. Solu-Medrol® vs. Prednison®).

For patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy before the first baseline is recorded in the system, this has to be recorded in the patient baseline section “past immunosuppressive treatment” in the ‘Patient BL’-Form.

In patients on maintenance immunosuppression that started prior to transplantation, enter the date of the first dose given in the patient baseline CRF. If the date is unknown, enter the date of transplantation. 

If possible, in the immunosuppressive treatment use product names (Prograf ®, Advagraf®, CellCept®, Myfortic®, etc.) so that drug changes can be easily followed.

.. tip:: Sometimes the drug is changed from an original to a generic preparation. In this case you have to stop the original and enter the new generic form. As date of stop and start enter the one detected in the medical report.

Nulojix®/Belatacept
----------------------------

For Belatacept - given every 4 weeks instead of Tacrolimus - enter one start and one stopp date only. It dosen’t need to have a start and stop date for every administration.

Immunosuppression given as therapy for other diseases
------------------------------------------------------------

Enter any given immunosuppression, even if it’s not given to prevent allograft rejection but to treat an other systemic disease. (e.g. Humira®/ Adalimumab given to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis or Prednison® prescribed as part of a chemotherapeutic tereatment plan). 

5.2.3. Infectious disease prophylaxis
====================================================

Drugs (antibiotics and antifungals) that are given for more than 3 days without symptoms and without microbiological documentation of a specific pathogen (prior to or during transplant surgery) have to be recorded as ID prophylaxis (classification of these drugs has to be made by the local ID-specialist).

Drugs (antibiotics and antifungals) that are given for more than 3 days without symptoms but with microbiological documentation of a specific pathogen will be recorded as an ID-event or as a treated probable infection (classification has to be done by the local ID-specialist).

Amphotericin B
------------------

Amphotericin B is only captured in the form of inhalation or as systemic application (i.v. or novel oral formulations) in the STCS. If a patient is given both Amphotericin B systemic and aerosol, then both should be registered.

.. warning:: Topical application of Amphotericin B in the mouth i.e. suspension/lozenges in the form of Ampho-Moronal/Nystatin® are no longer captured in the STCS since approx. 2014.

Infectious disease prophylaxis given for a previous transplantation that is not registered in STCS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to N. Müller, ID-prophylaxis (and other drugs) given for a previous organ-TX - regardless of wheter the organ is registered in the STCS or not – **should be entered** in the STCS.

5.2.4. Different other drug treatment
===============================================

Enter Legalon® in other drugs.

Privigen/IVIG and PEX in case of FSGS recurrence
--------------------------------------------------------

Enter Privigen/IVIG and PEX as maintenance Immunosuppression if given as treatment of FSGS post-TX (enter PEX in the ‘Non-pharmacological Treatment’ section).

Privigen/IVIG in case of BK-Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------

According to N. Müller, Privigen or any other IVIG given as treatment of a BK-Virus Infection should be entered in other drug prescriptions as it is not given as (ID-) phophylaxis.

Hepatect®/Antiviral Therapy
----------------------------------

According to B. Müllhaupt/USZ Hepatect post-op should be entered as prophylaxis.
Other antiviral therapies must be entered in ‘Other Drugs’ (e.g. Tenofovir).

5.2.5. Non-Pharmacological Treatment
===========================================

There are two treatments that can be entered in this cathegory:

*	Photopheresis and
*	Plasmapheresis/PE

For these treatments enter one start and one stop date only. It **does not need** to have a start and stop date for every single treatment.

5.1. Patient Diagnosis List
******************************

*In construction*

5.2. Treatment
***********************

.. image:: Treatm1.png

The container ‘Treatment’ contains ‘drug-prescriptions’ as well as ‘non-pharmacological treatments’.

In the ‘drug prescription’ we distinguish between:

*	Induction
*	Maintenance Immunosuppression
*	Infectious disease prophylaxis and
*	Other Drugs

Per default, when accessing the treatment container you land on the register with the ‘Active Treatments’. You can easily switch to ‘All Treatments’ (where active and stopped drugs are shown) or ‘Stopped Treatments’ in the register.

.. image:: Treatm2.png

When entering a new treatment you can select the toggle product or substance and then search for the according item from the list.

.. image:: Treatm3.png

If a product is not in the list, please switch to the "Substance" tab (see green arrow) and enter the substance of the product.

If possible, in the immunosuppressive treatment use product names (Prograf ®, Advagraf®, CellCept®, Myfortic®, etc.) so that drug changes can be easily followed.
In all other drugs choose the entry that is easier for you (e.g. Instead of entering Amlodipin/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazid as three different substances enter it as one product, Exforge HCT®).

**Drugs start and stop date**

This applies for all drugs, but especially for ‘others’ as this is the cathegory that seems to be the most difficult to find start and stop dates.

*Start date*:
Usually in a FUP it is manageable to find the start date of a medication. For baseline date it is different and can be time consuming. Not finding a start date and having to enter ‘missing’ reflects reality. Nevertheless, try to find a start date of the ‘other’ drugs that were taken before TPX.
If you can’t find an exact date, use the approach we use for the FUPs, using the date of the first report it was mentioned and if this is not the real start date, select ‘estimated date’ in the accuracy drop-down.

*Stop date*:
If the stop of a drug is in the actual follow-up period, but you do not know the exact date, enter the date when it was last recorded, indicating the accuracy of the stop date with ‘day uncertain’, ‘day/month uncertain’ or as ‘estimated date’. Same for start days.
You can, if you wish to, enter a note in the comment field, such as ‘after consultation on 03.03.2024 further application of the product is not clear’ or ‘no documentation of the substance after the consultation on the 05.03.2024’. 

**Stop Date in drugs other than ‘Maintenance Immunosuppression’**

*In construction*

5.2.1 Induction
=====================

.. note:: An induction therapy is given to ‘prepare’ the recipient for a new organ. The induction can be given shortly before and after TX or –e.g. in ABO-incompatible living donation- for a longer period prior to TX. Induction therapy may be given also as prophylaxis or therapy in case of an acute rejection.

Every treatment that is used for induction has to be indicated. If the induction was initiated prior to the transplantation (for instance for ABO incompatible transplantations) the date of induction treatment (e.g. one month or earlier before transplantation) has to be entered in the database.

Use the “Add medication”-button if there is more than one Induction therapy.

Special cases of induction
-----------------------------------

Plasmapheresis prior to a [living (kidney-)] transplantation has to be entered as induction in the ‘Non-pharmacological treatment’ section.

If a Patient with Islets-TX recieves Enbrel® (Etanerceptum), enter this as Induction.

Induction given in more than one dose
-----------------------------------------

Induction, even if given in two or more doses on e.g. Day 0 and Day +4, should be entered as one entry with the first application as start date and the last application as stopp date.

5.2.2. Maintenance immunosuppression
========================================

.. note:: The maintenance immunosuppression is given to avoid a rejection of the new organ.

Any glucocorticoid treatment is recorded as maintenance immunosuppression and not induction. Please differenciate between i.v. and p.o. application form (i.e. Solu-Medrol® vs. Prednison®).

For patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy before the first baseline is recorded in the system, this has to be recorded in the patient baseline section “past immunosuppressive treatment” in the ‘Patient BL’-Form.

In patients on maintenance immunosuppression that started prior to transplantation, enter the date of the first dose given in the patient baseline CRF. If the date is unknown, enter the date of transplantation. 

If possible, in the immunosuppressive treatment use product names (Prograf ®, Advagraf®, CellCept®, Myfortic®, etc.) so that drug changes can be easily followed.

.. tip:: Sometimes the drug is changed from an original to a generic preparation. In this case you have to stop the original and enter the new generic form. As date of stop and start enter the one detected in the medical report.

Nulojix®/Belatacept
----------------------------

For Belatacept - given every 4 weeks instead of Tacrolimus - enter one start and one stopp date only. It dosen’t need to have a start and stop date for every administration.

Immunosuppression given as therapy for other diseases
------------------------------------------------------------

Enter any given immunosuppression, even if it’s not given to prevent allograft rejection but to treat an other systemic disease. (e.g. Humira®/ Adalimumab given to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis or Prednison® prescribed as part of a chemotherapeutic tereatment plan). 

5.2.3. Infectious disease prophylaxis
====================================================

Drugs (antibiotics and antifungals) that are given for more than 3 days without symptoms and without microbiological documentation of a specific pathogen (prior to or during transplant surgery) have to be recorded as ID prophylaxis (classification of these drugs has to be made by the local ID-specialist).

Drugs (antibiotics and antifungals) that are given for more than 3 days without symptoms but with microbiological documentation of a specific pathogen will be recorded as an ID-event or as a treated probable infection (classification has to be done by the local ID-specialist).

Amphotericin B
------------------

Amphotericin B is only captured in the form of inhalation or as systemic application (i.v. or novel oral formulations) in the STCS. If a patient is given both Amphotericin B systemic and aerosol, then both should be registered.

.. warning:: Topical application of Amphotericin B in the mouth i.e. suspension/lozenges in the form of Ampho-Moronal/Nystatin® are no longer captured in the STCS since approx. 2014.

Infectious disease prophylaxis given for a previous transplantation that is not registered in STCS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to N. Müller, ID-prophylaxis (and other drugs) given for a previous organ-TX - regardless of wheter the organ is registered in the STCS or not – **should be entered** in the STCS.

5.2.4. Different other drug treatment
===============================================

Enter Legalon® in other drugs.

Privigen/IVIG and PEX in case of FSGS recurrence
--------------------------------------------------------

Enter Privigen/IVIG and PEX as maintenance Immunosuppression if given as treatment of FSGS post-TX (enter PEX in the ‘Non-pharmacological Treatment’ section).

Privigen/IVIG in case of BK-Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------

According to N. Müller, Privigen or any other IVIG given as treatment of a BK-Virus Infection should be entered in other drug prescriptions as it is not given as (ID-) phophylaxis.

Hepatect®/Antiviral Therapy
----------------------------------

According to B. Müllhaupt/USZ Hepatect post-op should be entered as prophylaxis.
Other antiviral therapies must be entered in ‘Other Drugs’ (e.g. Tenofovir).

5.2.5. Non-Pharmacological Treatment
===========================================

There are two treatments that can be entered in this cathegory:

*	Photopheresis and
*	Plasmapheresis/PE

For these treatments enter one start and one stop date only. It **does not need** to have a start and stop date for every single treatment.

5.3. Lab
**************

.. image:: ContLab1.png

For all data collections, please always use the most actual available lab. It might be that this are not the results you can find in the hospital internal lab but in an external report. 

5.3.1. Patient lab
==========================

We record the following values both in the baseline and in the follow-up until and including FUP 10 years:

•	Cholesterol
•	HLD-cholesterol
•	LDL-cholesterol
•	Plasma glucose (not indicating wether it is a fasting or a random sample)
•	HbA1c
•	Creatinine and
•	Total bilrubin.

As always, select ‘missing’ if a specific test has not been done or the date of the performed lab is unknown.

.. tip:: In the lipid status and bilirubin you can change the detection that is pre-set to ‘mesurable’ to ‘not mesurable’.

.. note:: In case no lab at all has been performed in the follow-up period, please do not forget to set the labs toggle in the patient follow-up form to ‘no’.

5.3.2. Organ lab
============================

For every transplanted organ we collect organ specific lab values during the period in which a full dataset is collected. Only after a kidney transplantation the organ specific lab is also collected in a minimal dataset. The collection of the organ specific lab starts with the first follow-up.

Per default, as SOAS case-ID, the SOAS-number of the latest same transplanted organ is selected. Especially in case you enter the graft loss and the re-transplantation at the same time, be careful to select the SOAS case-ID that refers to the entered lab.

Kidney
---------------------

We collect the proteinuria in mg/mmol. 
In the detection choose between ‘below detection limit’, ‘measurable’ and ‘above detection limit’. In case the result is ‘below detection limit’ enter ‘0’ as result, in case it is ‘above detection limit’ enter ‘missing’ as value.

Heart
----------------

We do not collect any bloodwork in heart transplanted patients but in the organ follow-up you can find physiological assessments that are measured.

Islets and Pancreas
------------------------

The post-tx lab is divided in ‘islets & pancreas specific lab’ and in ‘Stimulation Lab’.

.. image:: ContLab2.png

Islets & Pancreas Specific Lab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We collect the proteinuria in mg/mmol. In the detection choose between ‘below detection limit’, ‘measurable’ and ‘above detection limit’. In case the result is ‘below detection limit’ enter ‘0’ as result, in case it is ‘above detection limit’ enter ‘missing’ as value.

In the CGMS (Continuous glucose monitoring system) we enter values that are retrieved via a CGM system. Please enter the values you find in the data download or in a medical report:

•	Target range, also known as TIR (time in range) indicates blood glucose values between .3,9 and 10,0 mmol/l
•	Hypoglycaemia indicates values below 3,9 mmol/l in %
•	Hyperglycaemia indicates values above 10,0 mmol/l in %
•	The avarage glucose in mmol/l (Ø SG, Gluc. capt. moyen) and the 
•	Coefficient of variability in %.

The question about severe hypoglycaemia can be answerd with ‘Yes’, ‘No’ or ‘missing’.

.. note:: Note that severe hypoglycaemia refers to hypoglycaemic incidents in which the patient needed external help.

Lastly we collect a C-peptide in pmol/L and the value is random, meaning not specifically a fasting or post-prandial value. In the detection choose between ‘below detection limit’, ‘measurable’ and ‘above detection limit’. In case the result is ‘below detection limit’ enter ‘0’ as result, in case it is ‘above detection limit’ enter ‘missing’ as value.

Stimulation Lab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please enter the stimulation method used in the test, choosing from:

•	Stimulation method
•	Glucagon
•	Arginin
•	Intravenous glucose tolerance test
•	Oral glucose tolerance test or
•	Mixed meal.

In the stimulation lab we collect basal and stimulated values of the following variables:

•	C-peptide (pmol/L) and
•	Insulinemia (pmol/L).

In the detection choose between ‘below detection limit’, ‘measurable’ and ‘above detection limit’. In case the result is ‘below detection limit’ enter ‘0’ as result, in case it is ‘above detection limit’ enter ‘missing’ as value.

Liver
----------

.. image:: ContLab3.png

In liver, we collect:

•	A liver lab with different chemical and haematological measurements
•	Tumor marker–in patients transplanted due to a liver cancer and 
•	Virology.

Liver lab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We collect the following test results:

•	ALAT in IU/l
•	Factor V in %
•	INR
•	Albumin in g/l and
•	Sodium in mmol/l.

Tumor Marker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: Tumor marker are only collected if the underlying disease for the transplantation is **liver cancer**.

We collect the value of the Alpha-FP (AFP) in μg/l.

In the Pre-transplant tumor marker section, you need to indicate the monitoring phase in which the Alpha-FP value has been determined, choosing from:

•	Peak (Peak value can be at any given time before transplantation)
•	Waitlisting (value at the time the patient was set on the waitlist) and the value
•	Closest to transplantation.

Please enter all available cathegories of values and enter them in two cathegories, if e.g. peak and wait listing value are the same.

In the **Post-transplant tumor** marker section, we collect the most actual Alpha-FP value available.

Virology
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please enter the most actual HCV RNA and HBV DNA results. Please be careful to enter the HBV DNA in the fields with the correct unit of measurement (IU/ml or copies/ml).

In the detection choose between ‘below detection limit’, ‘measurable’ and ‘above detection limit’. In case the result is ‘below detection limit’ enter ‘0’ as result, in case it is ‘above detection limit’ enter ‘missing’ as value.

Lung
---------------

In the Lung specific tests, please enter a FEV1 in liter and % predicted as well as a FVC in liter and % predicted.

In the Lung FEV1 Best Post enter the two FEV1 best values in the corresponding follow-up period:

•	Enter the two best results with a minimum time span of 3 weeks between results.
•	Only create a new FEV Best in later FUP`s if the results are higher than the previous best!
•	However, it may occur that in the present FUP only one FEV is better than that of  the previous results – in this situation create a new “best” by taking the previous FEV best with the most recent high result – even if the previous best result is from another FUP period!

Small bowel
---------------

We collect the following test results:

•	Albumin in g/l
•	ALAT in IU/l
•	ASAT in IU/l
•	Citrulin in μmol/l
•	Conjugated bilirubin in μmol/l
•	Factor V in %
•	Fibrinogen in g/l
•	INR
•	Maximal D-xylose absorption in mmol/l (convert mg/dl to mmol/l by dividing the value by 15.38)
•	Prealbumin in mg/l
•	PT (prothrombin time) in % and the 
•	Fasting triglycerides in mmol/l.

Lab in minimal data
-------------------------

In minimal dataset, we only collect the value of the creatinine and the date the lab was performed. Please leave all other fields empty.

The organ specific lab in minimal datasets is only collect it in kidney follow-ups.

5.4. Stop
*************

.. image:: ContStop1.png

In the **Stop container** both *drop-out* and/or *death* can be entered.

.. warning:: Before entering a stop, be sure to add a FUP to enter all available data from before the drop-out or death.

.. note:: In case of death, if there is no official information after the last FUP attach a death form without a FUP form.

The follow-up of a patient ends with the patient’s death or drop out. The follow-up does not end when a patient withdraws consent. By law, such patients have to be followed to collect the minimal data prospectively.

It is crucial, whenever the follow-up for a certain patient ends, that the most appropriate date of end of follow-up is registered in the STCS system, i.e.:

•	The date of death
•	The date of dropout: If the exact date is unknown, use the date when the patient was last known to be alive (e.g. last contact with GP, last follow-up visit at the center, last consultation at emergency department etc.) and enter a respective note in the comment field.

5.4.1. Drop-out
======================

Drop out is defined as a patient who does not show up for a scheduled follow-up visits or who does not respond at all to any attempts of contact in a time window of at least 6 months and after at least three written and three telephonic invitations to attend a follow-up visit.

There can be a few different causes that lead to a drop-out. In 3LC, we have the option to choose between:

•	Non-response to several invitations
•	Too sick or handicapped to continue
•	Patient wishes to discontinue (Study fatigue)
•	Moved away, can not continue
•	Other (enter reason in comment field)

To add a drop-out, open the stop container and add a new field using the + button.

.. image:: ContStop2.png

Add all requested data in the appropriate fields and set the form to complete as soon as all the necessary information is entered. The accuracy of the date of drop-out can be indicated.

.. image:: ContStop3.png

A drop-out is visible in the patient overview.

.. image:: ContStop4.png

If a patient can be re-followed after a drop out, it is possible to stop the drop-out form and continue with the collection of data following the usual FUP-schedule. To do so, go to the stop-container and edit the (most recent) drop-out.

.. image:: ContStop5.png

There change ‘Back to STCS’ from ‘False’ to ‘True’ and enter the date the pateint was re-continued to be followed.

.. image:: ContStop6.png

The ‘Back to STCS’ will then be shown in the Patient Overview.

.. image:: ContStop7.png

5.4.2. Death
==================

The cause of death must be confirmed by a physician. Causes of death are adjudicated based on death certificates, autopsy reports or the last medical report. Indicate multiple entries with +.

To add a death, open the stop container and add a new field using the + button.

.. image:: ContStop8.png

Add all requested data in the appropriate fields and set the form to complete as soon as all the necessary information is entered.
The accuracy of the date of death can be indicated.

.. image:: ContStop9.png

5.4.2.1. ID as cause of death
====================================

If the (underlying) cause of death is an Infectious disease, be sure to check the box next to the ID leading to death to link the ID to the cause of death.

.. image:: ContStop10.png

ID as cause of death in minimal data
----------------------------------------------

As in minimal datasets no IDs are collected, you can not link an ID even if the/or one of the cause(s) of death or /one of the underlying cause(s) of death is/are an ID.

The system asks you to fill out the ID form corresponding to the cause of death but you do not need to do that. Just save it as CRF status ‘complete’ when all the needed data have been entered.

Also to be completed following a patient death
-----------------------------------------------------

Please stop all drugs and non-pharmacological tratments in case a patient dies. Indicate the date accuracy as you always do in the treatment section.

Death after Graft loss in Kidney, Pancreas and Islets Transplantation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case of kidney, pancreas and/or islets transplantation, after a graft loss (glo no active organ), if you get the information that the patient died (e.g. from the dialysis register or a doctor), enter death with date and cause unknown in 3LC if there is no info available regarding the death.

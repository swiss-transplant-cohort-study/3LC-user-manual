* CABG: Coronary Artery Bypass surgery, also known as heart bypass surgery
* ECMO: ExtraCorporal Membrane Oxygenation. In ECMO, blood is pumped outside of the body to a heart-lung machine. The machine removes carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-rich blood back to the body. Blood flows from the right side of the heart to the heart-lung machine. It's then rewarmed and sent back to the body. ECMO lets blood go around the heart and lungs. This allows the heart and lungs to rest and heal. ECMO is a form of extracorporeal life support (ECLS). *Source: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) - Mayo Clinic on 21.10.2025*

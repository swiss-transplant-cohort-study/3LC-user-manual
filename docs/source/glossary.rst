* CABG: Coronary Artery Bypass surgery, also known as heart bypass surgery
* BCT: Bronchiectasis
* CF: Cystic Fibrosis
* ECLS: Extra Corporeal Life 
* ECMO: ExtraCorporal Membrane Oxygenation. In ECMO, blood is pumped outside of the body to a heart-lung machine. The machine removes carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-rich blood back to the body. Blood flows from the right side of the heart to the heart-lung machine. It's then rewarmed and sent back to the body. ECMO lets blood go around the heart and lungs. This allows the heart and lungs to rest and heal. *Source: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) - Mayo Clinic on 21.10.2025*

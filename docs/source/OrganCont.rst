6. Organ Containers
#########################

6.1. Kidney
*************************

In the kidney container there are three sections:

•	Underlying disease (leading to transplantation)
•	Biopsy & Rejection and
•	Allograft morbidities.

6.1.1. Underlying disease
===============================

In this section we select and confirm the condition leading to transplantation.

To do so, we first need to enter this condition or disease in the ‘Patient Diagnosis List’ as ‘Condition Leading to Tpx’ or in an other category. For example ‘Diabetes mellitus type 1’ can be entered or as ‘Condition Leading to Tpx’ or as ‘Metabolic’. It will appear in both sections, regardless of where it has been entered.

As conditions or diseases leading to transplantation in kidney we select from the following:

However ‘Diabetic nephropathy’ can not be chosen. You have to enter the underlying disease to the diabetic nephropathy as ‘Diabetes mellitus type 1’, ‘Treated diabetes mellitus type 2’, ‘Postpancreatectomy diabetes’ or ‘Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM)’.

All entered diagnosis will appear in the section ‘Underlying Disease’ and you must confirm the condition leading to transplantation.

In all causes except ‘previous allograft failure’, you can enter a possible biopsy confirming the diagnosis. Be careful to enter the Biopsy ID that confirmed the disease and not just a biopsy of the native organ.

In case of two or more conditions leading to the same transplantation, the biopsies showing the diseases could be different one from another (e.g. one showing the diabetic nephropathy and a later one showing the hypertensive nephrosclerosis). Use the first biopsy that confirmed the disease.

6.1.2. Biopsy & Rejection
===============================

In this section we enter biopsies and rejections. We distinguish between ‘Time zero and reperfuion biopsies’ and ‘Post-transplant biopsies’.

Time zero and reperfusion biopsy
---------------------------------------

In the case of a **time zero** or **reperfusion biopsy** we enter the:

- Date of the biopsy
- Biopsy ID
- Type of biopsy

  •	Pre-implantation (allograft)
  •	At reperfusion
  •	Native organ

- Banff score. In the Banff score we select the values indicated in the biopsy. In case a value is not done or not listed, please choose ‘missing’. If the value can not be evaluated, select this from the drop-down menu.

If the biopsy lists one of the following diagnosis, please enter them in the ‘Allograft morbidities‘ section as ‘allograft disease’:

•	Acue tubular necrosis (ATN)
•	Chronic lesions, not specified
•	CNI nephrotoxicity
•	De novo glomerulonephritis/Vasculitis
•	Diabetic nephropathy
•	Graft pyelonephritis
•	Hemolytic uremic syndrome/ Thrombotic microangiopathy
•	PyVAN
•	Recurrence of initial disease or
•	Other (specifyng a major disease of the allograft in the comment section).

Post-Transplant biopsy and rejection
----------------------------------------

In the case of a biopsy performed **after transplantation**, we enter:

- Date of the biopsy
- Biopsy ID
- Type of biopsy:

  •	Diagnostic biopsy
  •	Protocol biopsy or
  •	other

- Banff score. In the Banff score we select the values indicated in the biopsy. In case a value is not done or not listed, please choose ‘missing’. If the value can not be evaluated, select this from the drop-down menu. You also have the option to choose ‘All missing’ if Banff score was not evaluated in the biopsy.

In the ‘Clinical and pathological diagnosis’ part, we enter:

•	Rejection (Yes, biopsy proven; Yes, clinically suspected; No)
•	If the patient showed the presence or absence of clinical symptoms (clinical/subclinical)
•	The Pathology report summary/diagnosis (copy and paste this part from the biopsy report in whatever language the text is) and
•	If necessary, a comment.

When you select a ‘Yes’-option in the **rejection** field, you can choose the regimen(s) to treat this rejection in the section that appears below.

Select all that apply from the following list and do not forget to enter the treatment in the ‘Treatment’ section as drug prescription or non-pharmacological treatment:

•	No treatment of rejection
•	ATG
•	ATGAM
•	Campath
•	IG iv
•	Metyl-prednisone iv
•	OKT3
•	Photopheresis
•	Plasmapheresis/PE
•	Prednisone po
•	Rituximab
•	Thymoglobulin
•	Other (Specifying the treatment in the comment field)

If the biopsy lists one of the following diagnosis, please enter them in the ‘Allograft morbidities‘ section as ‘allograft disease’:

•	Acue tubular necrosis (ATN)
•	Chronic lesions, not specified
•	CNI nephrotoxicity
•	De novo glomerulonephritis/Vasculitis
•	Diabetic nephropathy
•	Graft pyelonephritis
•	Hemolytic uremic syndrome/ Thrombotic microangiopathy
•	PyVAN
•	Recurrence of initial disease or
•	Other (specifyng a major disease of the allograft in the comment section).

Clinically suspected rejection, not biopsy proven
--------------------------------------------------------

In case of a clinically suspected rejection, that is not biopsy proven, enter the date of the suspected rejection in the date field of the Post-Transplant biopsy (even if the name is missleading).
In ‘Type of biopsy’ and ‘Biopsy ID’ chose ‘missing’.
Set the whole Banff score on ‘missing’ by selecting the ‘Mark all as missing’ button. 

.. image:: OrgCont5.png

This will hide the Banff section.

In the ‘Clinical and pathological diagnosis’ select ‘Clinically suspected, not biopsy proven’ in the Rejection section, choose between subclinical and clinical and set the ‘Pathology report summary/diagnosis’ to ‘missing’.
Lastly enter all the applied treatment in the ‘Treatment’ section and save the whole section.

6.1.3. Allograft morbidities
=================================

Although called ‘allograft morbidities’, this section collects complications, diseases and a possible loss of the organ.

Complication
--------------------

In the complication section we collect major complications of the kidney allograft with the respective date of diagnosis. If the exact date is unknown, you can leave a comment in the comment section. The following complications are collected:

•	Biopsy-related complication
•	Hemorragic complication
•	Intraabdominal infection
•	Lymphocele
•	Obstruction
•	Renal artery stenosis/Kincking
•	Renal artery thrombosis
•	Renal vein thrombosis
•	Surgical site-infection and
•	Urine leak
•	Other

We also specify if the complication required a surgical intervention (select ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ accordingly or ‘Missing’ if you habe no information about the performance of a surgical intervention).

Do not enter ‘death’ as a complication itself. You might collect complications leading to death, but the death itself has to be eintered in the stop form with the immediate and underlying cause of death.

Allograft Disease
------------------------------

If a biopsy or a medical report lists one of the following diagnosis, please enter them as ‘allograft disease’:

•	Acue tubular necrosis (ATN)
•	Chronic lesions, not specified
•	CNI nephrotoxicity
•	De novo glomerulonephritis/Vasculitis
•	Diabetic nephropathy
•	Graft pyelonephritis
•	Hemolytic uremic syndrome/ Thrombotic microangiopathy
•	PyVAN
•	Recurrence of initial disease or
•	Other (specifying a major disease of the allograft in the comment section).

In case the diagnosis is biopsy proven, please select ‘Yes’ and choose the Biopsy ID from the drop-down list that is shown.

Graftloss
--------------

A graft loss is the loss of function of the kidney. It implies the end of data collection of this specific orgen but only of the other, patientspecific data, PSQ and possible sample, if no other organ is actively followed in the system!

To enter a graft loss in the organ container, first set the toggle “graft loss”/ “End of transplant episode” in the kidney FUP to yes. Only after that, you will be able to access the ‘graftloss’ section in the kidney container. 

.. image:: OrgCont7.png

If the kidney lost its function, enter the date of gradft loss (start of dialysis) and the cause of graft loss, selecting from:

•	Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
•	Biopsy-related complication
•	Chronic allograft nephropathy(CAN) 
•	CNI nephrotoxicity
•	Diabetic nephropathy
•	Graft pyelonephritis
•	Immunological
•	Intraabdominal infection
•	Obstruction
•	Primary non-function
•	PyVAN
•	Recurrence of initial disease
•	Renal artery stenosis/Kincking
•	Renal artery thrombosis
•	Renal vein thrombosis
•	Surgical site-infection
•	Thrombotic microangiopathy
•	Cause unknown
•	Other causes

In case of a re-transplantation the graft loss with its underlying disease will be shown per default as cause leading to (re-) TX.

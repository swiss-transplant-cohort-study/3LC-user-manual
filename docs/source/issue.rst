How to report an issue
############################

1. Introduction
*******************

This Document describes the procedure how issues should be reported to the Data Center (DC). Therefore it is important to distinguish different kinds of requests. Following a List of requests and to whom and How to report it. In general:

.. tip:: If in doubt, open a ticket and do not send a mail!

#. Submit any kind of STCS Data requests via: https://www.stcs.ch/submit-request (as until now)

#. If you have data entry questions: ask the HLDM, Joëlle Dreifuss (joellelynn.dreifuss@usz.ch). Joëlle will answer directly or, if the topic needs further clarification, bring it up in the HLDM-CDM meeting on Wednesday and then send out the answer. Example of a question for the HLDM: Where to enter something or if there is the need to enter something, inputs on 3LC like the order in the kidney “biopsy & rejection” section.

#. If you have issues with the system and you can access 3LC:
create a 3lc ticket (example: the system needs improvement that are not urgent, things that need to be discussed with other LDM)

#. For Error 500 and urgent 3LC issues:
   #. If you can access 3LC: open a 3LC ticket
   #. If you cannot access the system: send a mail to stcs-3lc@usb.ch this mail goes directly to the IT

#. For regular 3LC issues regarding DQC: create a 3LC ticket 

#. If 3lc is down send a mail stcs-3lc@usb.ch

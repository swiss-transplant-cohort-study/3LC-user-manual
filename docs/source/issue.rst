Joëlle will answer directly or, if the topic needs further clarification, bring it up in the HLDM-CDM meeting on Wednesday and then send out the answer.
Example for question to HLDM: Where to enter something or if there is the need to enter something, inputs on 3LC like the order in the kidney “biopsy & rejection” section

#. If you have issues with the system and you can access 3LC:
create a 3lc ticket (example: the system needs improvement that are not urgent, things that need to be discussed with other LDM)

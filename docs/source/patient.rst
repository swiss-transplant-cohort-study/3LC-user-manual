Patient Enrollment
########################

TEEEEST

Similarly to :ref:`donor`, to enroll a patient select *Create and Search* > *Patient enrollment*.

Administrative data
***********************

The first step is to add the administrative data for the patient, such as:

* Initials
* Gender at birth
* Date of birth
* Blood group

.. image:: AdminData.png

Once this is filled in, please proceed by clicking "Save and add Cons".

.. note:: Use the intial of each name in uppercase, with "-" as separator between the First name initial/s and Last name initial/s. Examples: Georgios Kyriakos Panayiotou -> GK-P, Rosa Dolores Alverío Marcano -> RD-AM. When family names include particles are treated as a further Family name: e.g.Charles De Gaulle -> C-DG, Miguel De Oliveira -> M-DO
How to enter initials into the New system:

.. tip:: When selecting the date of birth, if you click on the "Month", a month view appears. If you further click on the year, a year view appears. This will help you navigating through time and selecting the right date of birth.

.. warning:: The patient should be entered in the database within 7 days after transplantation (two working days).

Consent
**********

Registration (SOAS Listing)
************************************

The Ethics Committee has approved the registration of waitlisted (not yet transplanted) patients in the database. Registered information includes current consent status. No collection of clinical/research data is allowed before transplantation and proper enrollment in the Cohort only starts at the time of transplantation.

.. tip::
   1. Register patient in STCS when you send Patient information to patient
   2. Add SOAS number and Organ
   3. Register consent as “Absent (awaiting)” with date when ICF sent out
   4. When you get consent form back then update consent with date
   5. Enroll patient only once transplanted (add transplantation and donor etc)


.. note::
   If the patient dies while on the waiting list, this information should not be entered in the system as it is a clinical data. The patient should 
   be left “open” in waiting list.
